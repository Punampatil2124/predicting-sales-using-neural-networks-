🧠 Sales Prediction System using Neural Networks
Welcome to the Sales Prediction System project, developed by Punam Patil. This project demonstrates how a simple neural network built with PyTorch can predict the number of items sold (e.g., lemonade) based on features such as weather conditions, weekend status, signage, and pricing.

📌 Project Overview
This system uses a synthetic dataset to train a neural network to predict sales outcomes. The model learns from features like:
Weekend or not
Sunny weather
Warm temperature
Presence of a big sign
Price of the product
Using these features, the model can accurately forecast expected sales volumes, which can be valuable for demand forecasting and inventory planning.
